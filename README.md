# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
## Overview
In this project,
I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
I wrote code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
this code takes in raw input to create an interactive experience to present these statistics.

## What Software Do you Need?
the following software requirements apply:
- You should have Python 3, NumPy, Pandas and Jupyter notebook installed using Anaconda

## The Datasets
are randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

- Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
- End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
- Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
- End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
- Gender
- Birth Year

## Statistics Computed
computing a variety of descriptive statistics about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington
In this project, I wrote code to provide the following information:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip
- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration
- total travel time
- average travel time

#4 User info
- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
The Files

## You will need the three city dataset files if you wanted to do the project yourself:
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv

## Bonus

For every statistics that could be visualized I made a visulaizaion for it using Matplotlib to make it easier to understand.
